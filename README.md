# Crystal Collector

This is a simple counting math game. A random number is selected when the start button is clicked. Each crystal is assigned a random number between 1-12, which is added to the score when clicked. If the user score matches the random number assigned at the beginning, the user wins. If the user exceeds the random number, the user loses. Sessions wins/losses are tabulated.
