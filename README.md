# Crystal Collector

This is a simple counting math game. Click the start button to begin. At that point, a random number between 19-120 is selected. Each crystal is assigned a random number between 1-12, whose value is added to the total score when clicked. If the user score matches the random number assigned at the beginning, the user wins that round. If the user exceeds the random number, the user loses. Session wins/losses are tabulated and tracked.
